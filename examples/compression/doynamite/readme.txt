What changed compared to v1.0?
 Literals are now copied forwards and thus the safety margin is low (typically 4 bytes or less) - Needless to say that the format is incompatible with v1.0
 Selfextracting executables can now be generated by the cruncher
 An optimal loading address can be generated, based on the estimated safety margin
 No more .prg/.bin autodetection. Default input filetype is now .prg, raw binaries can be packed with --binfile
 Iterative mechanism to find the best offset lengths and possibility to add the offset table to the output file
 Simple version in /simple/ generates ~0,5% bigger files but has a $e1 bytes big depacker and depacks around 5-10% faster. This is achieved by rearranging the encoding and forgoing on the offsets base adjustment.

The file to be compressed is a required argument, in addition the following switches are available:
 -o: Specify the output file name. By default the input file with an .lz extension.
 --window: Specify the window size for with streaming decompression.
 --per-page: Force the windowed encoding for regular files. This is handy when combining both types of data.
 --cut-input: Only specific segment of the file.
 --offset-lengths: Use an alternate set of offset lengths. For e.g. --offset-lengths 3/6/8/10:4/7/10/13
 --emit-offset-tables: Generate the appropriate decruncher tables for the chosen offset lengths.
 --statistics: Display some basic information about the types of matches made.
 --best-offset-tables: Find the best offset lengths for optimal compression results. This is still slow and done lazy.
 --binfile: Read from a raw binary without a preceeding loadaddress. As a default the cruncher expects a .prg-style file.
 --include-tables: Include the offset tables (24 byte without gaps) to the output file, straight after load- and depack-address.
 --sfx: Spit out a selfextracting .prg
 --level: Spit out a level-packed file, including a generated load- and depack-address (the load-address of the .prg).
 --raw: Spit out the raw pakced data without any additional bytes added before.

In case the readme.txt of the previous version might be a good read.
